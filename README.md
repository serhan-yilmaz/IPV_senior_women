# Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Against Senior Women
This repository contains supplementary materials of "*Mining Electronic Health Records to Identify Adverse Health Correlates of Intimate Partner Violence against Older Women*".

### Supplementary Data 1 - Raw Data
[Supplementary Data 1](supplementary_data_1.xlsx) contains the frequencies of all 18863 diagnostic terms in all analyzed cohorts, including:
- Background (BG) cohort: All records for women of 18-65 years of age.
- Intimate partner violence (IPV) cohort: All records for women of 18-65 years of age, suffering from IPV.
- Background cohort for older women (Senior): All records for older women of 65+ years of age.
- Intimate partner violence for older women (SeniorIPV): All records for older women of 65+ years of age, suffering from IPV.

### Supplementary Data 2 - Terms that are prevalent in older women suffering from IPV
[Supplementary Data 2](supplementary_data_2.xlsx) contains the results of the prevalence analysis for IPV in older women (65+) population. 
The terms identified as prevalent here are significantly associated with IPV (measured by log-odds ratio) in older women population. That is, these terms exhibit significantly higher frequency in the older women population when present together with intimate partner violence. 

### Supplementary Data 3 - Terms that are prevalent in younger women suffering from IPV
[Supplementary Data 3](supplementary_data_3.xlsx) contains the results of the prevalence analysis for IPV in the background (18-65 years of age) population. The terms identified as prevalent here are significantly associated with IPV (measured by log-odds ratio) in younger women (background) population. To be more specific, these terms exhibit significantly higher frequencies in the younger population when present together with intimate partner violence. 

### Supplementary Data 4 - Terms that are more differentially prevalent with IPV in older women
[Supplementary Data 4](supplementary_data_4.xlsx) contains the results of the differential prevalence analysis for IPV, comparing the older women (65+) population with the background (18-65) population. The terms identified as differentially prevalent here have significantly higher association (measured by log-odds ratio) with IPV in older women population compared to background. Essentially, these terms are more commonly observed in older victims of IPV compared to younger victims.
